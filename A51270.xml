            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then want they to the Ca≈øtle of the ≈øorrowful Lady, who upon notice of what they were, came down and ≈øaluted them, in loving wife, cau≈øing her Damo≈øels to dre≈øs their wounds, and inquired after divers Knights, but above all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> for who≈øe ≈øake ≈øhe had betaken her ≈øelf to that ≈øolitary manner of living.</p>
               <p>To the Reque≈øt of the Lady, Prince <hi>Primalion</hi> an≈øwered, That the Adventure of the <hi>Unfortunate Ca≈øtle</hi> was fini≈øhed, and that the Knights that had long been impri≈øoned therein, were fat at liberty; and among≈øt the re≈øt, Prince <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> in ≈øearch of whom ≈øo many Knights had left their Country;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30531:37"/>
and that he at pre≈øent flouri≈øhed in his Father's Court, in the embraces of the fair <hi>Flerida.</hi> This news greatly revived the ≈øorrowful Lady, who ≈øaid ≈øhe joyed in nothing more than to hear of the Princes ≈øafety, whom ≈øhe long ≈øince ≈øuppo≈øed to have been dead, though he had proved mo≈øt unkind to her, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her after ≈øhe had fixed on him an unalterable love; yet ≈øtace there were ≈øome hopes left that ≈øhe might once more ≈øee him, ≈øhe would from thence forward mitigate her grief; And ≈øo, ≈øoon after the Prince's departure, ≈øhe betook her ≈øelf to the <hi>Garden of Virgins,</hi> a place ≈øo called for its plea≈øant ≈øcituation.</p>
               <p>The Princes (cured of their wounds) in a re≈øpectful manner took their leaves of each other, as al≈øo of the Ladies, the one for <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> and the other for <hi>Spain,</hi> where his fair <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragarda</hi> re≈øided. Prince <hi>Primalion</hi> riding through divers Countries, without meeting with any Adventure, at length arrived at the Fanous City of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> which in the evening he entered <hi>Incognito,</hi> and continued till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at what time he gave notice to the Secretarys, that they ≈øhould inform the Emperor, that a Knight arrived from the Court of <hi>England,</hi> was de≈øirous to wait upon him; this known, the Emperor greatly rejoyced, fora≈ømuch as he had not heard from thence of a long time; yet <hi>Primalion</hi> keeping his Helmet cla≈øp'd, delayed to di≈øcover his knowledge, till ≈øuch time as the Empre≈øs <hi>Gridona</hi> and all the Ladies were pre≈øent, who being immediately ≈øent for, and greatly de≈øirous to hear the long expected news, the Prince declared from point to point all that had happened, and above all, how <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who fini≈øhed the Adventure; was Son to <hi>Don Edoard</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Flerida.</hi> Then the Emperor earne≈øtly inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Son <hi>Primalion,</hi> ≈øaying he could have no re≈øt ≈øince his departure; whereupon the Prince, loath to ≈øuffer his Father longer to grieve, pulled off his Helmet, and di≈øcovered him≈øelf, to the Ioy of all pre≈øent, and of the whole Empire.</p>
               <p>But long it had not continued, e're a Me≈ø≈øenger came from the Soldian <hi>Bellagris</hi> with Letters-Credentials, to inform the Emperor, that the Soldian of <hi>Babylon</hi> (at the in≈øtigation of <hi>Eutrope</hi> the Inchantre≈øs) had leavyed a great Army to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade

the Imperial Territories, but had been diverted by ≈øome of his own Subjects, who cau≈øed a mutiny, by rea≈øon of the exce≈ø≈øive Taxes he had rai≈øed on that occa≈øion; therefore he advi≈øed his Maje≈øty to be upon his Guard.</p>
               <p>This occa≈øioned no little con≈øternation in the Court; but in con≈øideration the Princes were relea≈øed, and upon their re-return, the mo≈øt Valiant rather de≈øired a War than feared it; yet preparation were made on all hands, not only defen≈øive, but offen≈øive.</p>

               <p>Here the Prince going on ≈øhore, knew by the many Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that was the place in which he had undergone ≈øuch danger; and carrying his Companions from place to place, he (to their great admiration) ≈øhewed and related the many ≈øtrange Encounters, but e≈øpecially that of the Fountain, where they found lying the bones of the Bea≈øts he had ≈ølain; and at the Ca≈øtle the Shield which (as a Trophie) he cau≈øed the ≈øubdued Knight to hang up, as a Memorial of that Adventure: The which done, they pa≈ø≈øed in a fair Garden, repleni≈øh'd with all the Pride of <hi>Flora,</hi> and adorned with Fruits, ≈øo lovely to the Eye, that a rarer ≈øight could not be found; when in the mid≈øt thereof there ≈øtood a Cry≈øtal Fountain, imbo≈ø≈øed with Silver Sculptures of many Stories, and rare Device.

               <p>
                  <hi>Know, Mo≈øt Pui≈ø≈øant Emperor, that from the Mighty</hi> Ottoman <hi>Emperor (my Lord and Ma≈øter) I am ≈øent to ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you in his Name, and to give you knowledge, that his Emperial Diadem has been ≈øtained, and its bright dazling Lu≈øtre much impaired, by the Indignity offered him, in the Per≈øon of his Daughter, conveyed from his Court by</hi> Florian, <hi>a Knight of your Court: Wherefore, if you expect Peace at his hands, it can be pre≈øerved at no other rate, than by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him up to be de≈øervedly puni≈øhed, who has offered ≈øuch in≈øolence to his</hi> Turki≈øh <hi>Maje≈øty, as to give the World occa≈øion of di≈øcour≈øe, and blot the Name of that fair Lady, who is the ≈øolace of his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This having ≈øaid, he ended; and the Emperor made this reply:</p>

at my Court, as ≈øhe could be regarded in her Fathers. As for the Prince you ≈øpeak of, though he is my Grand≈øon, yet he is not my Subject; nor can I compel free minds, if that I would; but ≈øurely rather than I would deliver him up to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters Rage, (were it in my power, and he would con≈øent) I'de freely hazard my Empire in Fortunes chance: And now you have my An≈øwer, you may ≈øtay and have the Freedom of my Court, or depart at Plea≈øure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor thus ending, with a Maje≈øtick frown greatly di≈ømayed the Amba≈ø≈øador, who without replying was about to retire to his Gallys, but that the Princes ≈øtayed him to make merry, and received the Emperors Letter, to which he con≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ≈øo after three days tarryance, he returned to him that ≈øent him; where I ≈øhall leave him, and return to Prince <hi>Florian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince, with his Troop of Ladies, having reached the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> ≈øent his E≈øquire to the King and Queen, to implore them that they would permit the Knights of their Court to Iu≈øt again≈øt a ≈øtrange Knight, in the behalf of their Ladies, for that he would maintain the Beauty of tho≈øe that accompanied him again≈øt any of the Court-Ladies, if ≈øo be it any Knights dur≈øt maintain the contrary. The King, who had delighted from his Youth in Feats of Arms, appeared no way aver≈øe, but rather de≈øired that the Valour of his Knights ≈øhould be tryed, whereupon he di≈ømi≈ø≈øed the E≈øquire with a promi≈øe that his Ma≈øters reque≈øt ≈øhould on the morrow be granted, and that for that night Lodgings ≈øhould be provided for him and his Lady. The Prince having now an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to try his force again≈øt the feeble Knights of <hi>Spain,</hi> made no doubt but by his Prowe≈øs to Eclip≈øe the Glory of that Court, in Honour of the Emperor, and therefore retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King <hi>Recinde</hi> great thanks.</p>
               <p>The night being ≈øpent in Mirth and Iollitry, the next morning they prepared for the Li≈øt, the Trumpets loudly ≈øounding thereto, which awakened the Knights; when mounting their Steeds, they advanced, and found the Prince
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30531:73"/>
in the Li≈øt; whereupon a <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Knight, in white Armour, with a wounded Heart in his Shield, confronted him, at what time the Prince ≈øent to acquaint him, That if him≈øelf was conquored, the Knight ≈øhould chu≈øe from among≈øt his Train the mo≈øt beautifull Damzel; but if he vanqui≈øhed the Knight, he would have his Mi≈øtri≈øs, and therefore required him to a≈ø≈øign her; to which the Knight who≈øe Name was <hi>Gonzales,</hi> ≈øent this Reply; That he doubted not but the ≈øtrange Knight was weary of his Female Company, and therefore came to put them off at any rate; but as for his Mi≈øtri≈øs, his power was ≈øo little over her, that ≈øhe was alltogether at her own di≈øpo≈øal. This an≈øwer ≈øo di≈øplea≈øed the Prince, that he gave ≈øignal for the Iu≈øt, without any conditions: When running furiou≈øly at each other, the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Knight was thrown from his Hor≈øe, with his Heels upwards, which ≈øo grieved him, that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Combat of the Sword, which the Prince as readily granted, but the King forbad it: Yet a ≈øecond Knight run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again≈øt the Prince, fared no better, and ≈øo a third, till all his Launces were broken, ≈øo that he was obliged to intreat of the King a new ≈øupply, and with them had the Iu≈øt ≈øix houres, none being able to unhor≈øe him, which ≈øore aba≈øhed the King, to ≈øee his Knights di≈øgraced, and the Fame of his Court Eclip≈øed by one Knight, in≈øomuch that he repented he had granted the di≈øport, and thereupon for that day cau≈øed it to cea≈øe, intending it ≈øhould be no more; but upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of ≈øome Knights, that upon the fame of the Exerci≈øe newly arrived there, it was renewed the next day; when as the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Knights fared no better than the day before, which cooled their courage.</p>
               <p>Matters going thus, the Prince re≈øolved to depart to the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Almorol</hi> the next morning, of which <hi>Arleucea</hi> having notice, watching her opportunity, when her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were a≈øleep, ≈øhe ≈øtole into the Prince's Lodging-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where a Taper was burning, and ≈øitting down upon his Bed-≈øide, began to ≈øigh out her pa≈ø≈øion in this order:</p>

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:30531:73"/>
                  <hi>O unfortunate that I am! How am I captivated in the ≈ønares of Love, and forced to do at upon the Man that ≈ølights my pa≈ø≈øion? O that I had never ≈øeen his face, unle≈øs he would have more regarded me, and pittied the Feavour that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumes me.</hi> This ≈øaid, ≈øhe began to weep tenderly; whereupon the Prince awaking, wondered to ≈øee a woman in his Chamber, but by the light di≈øcovering who it was; and ≈øhe ≈øtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing her lamentations, he comforted her in the be≈øt wi≈øe, promi≈øing that allthough him≈øelf intended not to marry her, yet he would be≈øtow her upon ≈øuch a Husband, as ≈øhould plea≈øe her: This ab≈øolute denyal di≈øturbed her more than before, ≈øo that ca≈øting her Arms about the Prince, ≈øhe lay as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced for a pretty ≈øpace; but recovering hee ≈øen≈øes, and mode≈øt ba≈øhfulne≈øs, ≈øhe left him, and retired to her Chamber; where awaking one of her Damzels named <hi>Polephemia,</hi> ≈øhe imparted to her the Secrets of her Heart, de≈øiring her to go to the Prince, and per≈øwade him that night to receive her into his Arms, and ≈øatisfie the de≈øires of a longing Virgin. But this Damzel, who was the ≈øame that put the inchanted King upon the Prince's finger, having the opportunity of being alone with him ≈øolicited her own (in≈øtead of her Ladies) cau≈øe ≈øo long, that he having born her good-will ever ≈øince he fir≈øt beheld her, laying niceties a≈øide, ≈øo dealt with her, that to both their contents he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed her Virgin Trea≈øure, and ≈øent her blithe and gay with Loves refre≈øhments, when the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dawn, to carry Cordial words to her di≈øcon≈øolate Lady, who little ≈øu≈øpected what had pa≈ø≈øed, yet de≈øired no greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs.</p>
               <p>In the morning early the Prince and his beautiful Female Troop taking leave of the King, Queen, and Court-Ladies, departed towards the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Almorol;</hi> but coming into a plea≈øant Valley before them, they beheld a Knight of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrous ≈ølye come riding on a Hor≈øe greater than <hi>Beaucephalus,</hi> with two E≈øquires of his attendance: When coming near the Prince, and beholding the Ladies, he rudely layed hold of <hi>Arleucea,</hi> ≈øwearing ≈øhe ≈øhould hear him company, and that two
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30531:74"/>
others ≈øhould be allotted to his E≈øquires: This rough and un≈øeemly action ≈øo moved the Prince, that drawing his Sword, he came at him to revenge the Injury, which the Knight (or rather Gyant) perceiving, let go his hold, and drawing his Ma≈ø≈øy Blade, a dreadfull Combat began; but ≈øo eager was the Prince to revenge the affront, that the Gyant received many wounds, till in the end fainting, through the lo≈øs of blood, he fell; when taking off his Helmet, the Prince being about to ≈ømite off his Head, his E≈øquires fell on their Knees, and with tears begged him to ≈øpare their Lords Life, which the Ladyes perceiving, interceded ≈øo much on his behalf, that the Prince was contented to ≈øpare his Life, conditionally, that he would tell his Name, and go to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and there relate what had befallen him; both which he ≈øwore to do, ≈øaying, <hi>He was called</hi> Trofolant the Fearfull; <hi>And as for the other part of his Oath, though it would redound much to his di≈øgrace, yet would he faithfully perform it:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was ≈øuffered to depart.</p>
               <p>The Prince having cha≈øti≈øed the in≈øolency of the Gyant, pa≈ø≈øed on till he met three Knights, compleatly armed, pa≈ø≈øing a little River, who e≈øpying one Knight conducting ≈øo many Ladyes, agreed among≈øt them≈øelves to take each of them one; whereupon coming up, one cho≈øe <hi>Arleucea,</hi> another <hi>Poliphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and the third <hi>Arte≈øia; Nay, Gentlemen,</hi> ≈øaid the Prince, <hi>you mu≈øt fir≈øt ask my leave, which (a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelves) you will not obtain, e're any of the≈øe Ladys fall to your ≈øhare.

               <p>The words of the Prince greatly plea≈øing the Knights,

they began to contemn his force, and vaunt of their own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour beyond mea≈øure; but ≈øo it happened, that in the Iu≈øt they were all overthrown, and remitted for a puni≈øhment of their pre≈øumption to the Ladies they had claimed, who injoyned them to tell their Names, and go to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> as had the Gyant, and there (in the pre≈øence of the King and his Knights) declare what had befallen them, and by who≈øe hand; to which with a mournful voice one of them replyed: <hi>That allthough the Sentence was ≈øevere, yet ≈øeeing it was their misfortune to be conquored, they would not decline it; As for our Names,</hi> ≈øaid he, <hi>I am called</hi> Grovanel, <hi>this other Knight is my Brother</hi> Brabazan, <hi>and the third</hi> Claribard; <hi>all of us Knights of the</hi> Spani≈øh <hi>Court, which makes us the lother to make our di≈øgrace publique there; yet upon the Oaths of our Knighthood, ≈øeeing the Ladys have injoyned it, it ≈øhall be performed:</hi> And thereupon the Prince di≈ømi≈ø≈øed them, and kept on his way towards the Ca≈øtle of the Gyant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morol.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Gyant <hi>Trofolant</hi> (according to his Oath) arriving at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> after admittance had to the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, began to declare the occa≈øion of his coming, and tell the whole matter, which did not a little perplex the King to know who the Knight with the Damzels was; but whil≈øt the doubt la≈øted, the other Knights came in, and became Relaters of their own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which ≈øtill increa≈øed the wonder, and ≈øomewhat le≈ø≈øened the di≈øgrace of tho≈øe Knights that had been overthrown in the pre≈øence of their Ladies, but in the end they concluded it mu≈øt be one of the invincible Sons of Prince <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> and thereupon re≈øted them≈øelves ≈øatisfied as well as they could.</p>
               <p>The Prince riding on in the company of his Ladies, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ≈øo long, that he came within ≈øight of <hi>Almorol</hi>'s Ca≈øtle, when to his beautifull Companions he thus began: <hi>Ladies know that we approach the Ca≈øtle where dwells the fair</hi> Miragarda, <hi>who≈øe Beauty is famed for excellent throughout the World, therefore agree among≈øt your ≈øelves who≈øe Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ≈øhall fight under:</hi> when as a murmure aro≈øe among≈øt them, every one thinking her ≈øelf the faire≈øt, till <hi>Poliphemia,</hi> who had a wonderfull conceit of her beauty, thus broke ≈øilence: <hi>Sir Knight, if you fight under Beauty's Banner, it behoves you to be loyal and con≈øtant in your Love, for I per≈øwade my ≈øelf, if the Knight that protects the Shield of</hi> Miragarda <hi>was not ≈øo, Fortune would not favour him as ≈øhe does, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe but ≈øome of us are as beautifull as ≈øhe; therefore if you are unfortunate in the Enterprize, attribute it to your

uncon≈øtancy, and not to the Defect of our Beauty.</hi> The Prince hearing her ≈øay thus much, could not refrain ≈ømiling to think of the e≈øteem ≈øhe had of her ≈øelf, and what had pa≈ø≈øed between them; yet giving her and the re≈øt many Complements, they at la≈øt came to the River <hi>The≈øin,</hi> that encompa≈ø≈øed the Ca≈øtle, on which they beheld <hi>Miragarda</hi> and her Damzels in a Boat, who≈øe beauty was ≈øo excellent, that it had well nigh conquored the Prince, but he who was alltogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant in Love, ≈øoon ≈øhook off her Chaines.</p>
               <p>The Prince had not long ≈øtayed before the Ca≈øtle, but <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi> ≈øent his E≈øquire to him, to acquaint him with the cu≈øtom of the Ca≈øtle; <hi>Nay,</hi> (≈øaid Prince <hi>Florian) tell thy Lord I am very well acquainted with the cu≈øtom, and came hither on purpo≈øe to break a Launce with the Guardian of</hi> Miragarda<hi>'s Beauty:</hi> Vpon notice whereof <hi>Florendos</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and prepared for the Iu≈øt; but the Prince (not de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to injure his Kin≈øman) declared that he would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Combat of the Sword, but came to ≈øhew his Ladys Pa≈øtime, not being <hi>Emulus</hi> to bereave him of his tru≈øt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Florendos</hi> ≈øaluted him, and was de≈øirous to know his Name, but he refu≈øed, ≈øo that the Iu≈øt began with great vehemency; yet ≈øuch was the regard that <hi>Florian</hi> had for his Nephew, that he would not di≈øgrace him in the fight of his Lady, who ≈øtood in the Window to behold the Iu≈øts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they broke three Launces without any advantage, which ≈øo inraged <hi>Florendos,</hi> (who was alltogether ignorant of his Adver≈øaries ≈øtrength) that he would have tryed the Combat of the Sword, but Prince <hi>Florian</hi> with gentle words per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded him to the contrary, de≈øiring that that might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>Almorol</hi> the Gyant, again≈øt whom he was de≈øirous to try his ≈øtrength; which made the Ladies that bore him company to ≈ømile, mi≈ø-doubting the Courage of their mo≈øt valiant Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almorol</hi> having notice that the combat was required a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, went to his fair Mi≈øtri≈øs, and required her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, who (becau≈øe the Iu≈øts were not decided) accorded to his

Reque≈øt; whereupon the Gyant came forth, and defied Prince <hi>Florian</hi> to the combat of the Sword, who (now at liberty to u≈øe his full ≈øtrength) greatly rejoyced; in≈øomuch that the combatants being in a readine≈øs, charged each other ≈øo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly, that wounds were received on both ≈øides, but the Prince (whom Fortune ever favoured) brought the Gyant to his mercy, yet would not injure his Life, allthough in his power, but ≈øuffered him to be carryed off, and his wounds to be healed, having ingaged, that if him≈øelf had been overcome, to have be≈øtowed <hi>Arleucea</hi> in Marriage upon the Gyant.</p>
               <p>During the time that <hi>Florendos</hi> and the attendants of the Ca≈øtle were carrying off the Gyant, and looking to his wounds, two Knights came riding up to the Shield of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> and laying hold on it, would have conveyed it thence, but Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> ob≈øerving his Rin≈øman to be ab≈øent, forbad them on their peril, yet they regarded not his Menaces, but dared him to the combat to defend it; whereupon he prepared him≈øelf for the Iu≈øt, and ran one of them with a ≈øtrong Staff through the Body, and layed the other on the Earth; by which time <hi>Florendos</hi> was arrived, greatly di≈øplea≈øed that the Iu≈øt ≈øhould be performed in his ab≈øence; but when he knew that his Kin≈øman <hi>Florian</hi> had done him that ≈øervice, he greatly rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and would have conducted him into the Ca≈øtle, but could not per≈øwade him to ≈øtay, for that he had promi≈øed to return to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to give tho≈øe Knights a further ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Prowe≈øs; whereupon taking leave, he departed with his Female Train, every one of which ≈øtriving to be highe≈øt in his favour.</p>
               <p>But far he had not rode e're he heard the piteous ≈øhreiks of a Lady on the other ≈øide of a River, and becau≈øe he could not conveniently come nearer, by rea≈øon of the depth of the water, he unarmed him≈øelf and ca≈øt it over, when-leaving the Ladies he had in guard, he ≈øwam cro≈øs the Flood, and entering the Thicket, beheld a Knight forcing a Damzel, whil≈øt another Knight was binding her E≈øquire to a Tree; which unmanly

abu≈øe, ≈øo inraged the Prince, that he commanded them upon pain of Death to de≈øi≈øt, but they being two to one ≈øeemed little to regard his threats, though afterwards they repented it: For the Prince being inraged at ≈øo great a wickedne≈øs as they were about to commit, having given them leave to put them≈øelves in a po≈øture of defence, charged them with ≈øuch fury, that he layed one of them breathle≈øs, and brought the other to his mercy, obligeing him to ask the Lady forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and taking an Oath of him, to go to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and make report of his Villany, and what had befallen him; and ≈øo unbinding the Damzels E≈øquire, he pa≈ø≈øed along the Bank of the River till he found a place fordable, over which he pa≈ø≈øed with the Lady and her E≈øquire, demanding the cau≈øe why they u≈øed ≈øuch violence, and how ≈øhe came to meet with them? to which ≈øhe an≈øwered, <hi>That being a Damzel, Attendant upon the Prince≈øs</hi> Miragarda, <hi>≈øhe obtained leave to go to the Court of</hi> Spain, <hi>to vi≈øit her friends, when as the≈øe Knights having been foiled at the Ca≈øtle of</hi> Almorol, <hi>to revenge that di≈øgrace, re≈øolved (upon their knowing who I was) to deprive me of my Honour, having ca≈øt Lots who ≈øhould have the fir≈øt E≈ø≈øay, and had ≈øucceeded in their Wickedne≈øs, had not kind Heaven happily ≈øent you to my re≈øcue.</hi>

               <p>The Damzel had ≈øcarce ended, when an Out-cry and Female Shreiks was heard, when the Prince looking up, beheld a Knight with <hi>Arleucea</hi> behind him, riding as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible away with her; whereupon he ha≈øtened to recover his Hor≈øe, which done, he rode after him, crying, <hi>Stay Uncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and be cha≈øtized for the In≈øolence you have offered to a Lady under my protection:</hi> Whereat the Knight turning about in great fury, ≈øet down the Lady, ≈øaying, <hi>He would be revenged for ≈øuch his bold interruption;</hi> whereupon drawing his Sword, he advanced, but received ≈øuch a welcome, that after ≈øix or ≈øeven exchanged blows, the Prince brought him under, and would have taken off his Head, but that he begging for life, <hi>Arleucea</hi> pittyed him and interceded on his behalf,
