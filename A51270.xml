            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU have before you a Book that has been in great Eſteem in moſt Nations, there being but few <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropian</hi> Languages, in which at this day it is not Extant: therefore ſeeing it written by others, in the honour of our Country, I thought it highly conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that my Country-man ſhould expreſs himſelf in his native Language, or ſtand or fall by the Cenſure of the Judicious Natives of this famous Sea-ſurrounded Iſle. I muſt confeſs there are many tracts of this Nature abroad in the world; but amongſt the number that have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if I may freely paſs my judgment, none have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if any have hitherto Equalized it. The ſubject is <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> to which are joyned State-Policies, Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems and <hi>Machavillian</hi>-Machinations, things worthy to be obſerved by the wiſeſt and worthieſt of <hi>Mankind;</hi> yet was it not ſo much written for profitable practice, as Pleaſure and Recreation, though it may more then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſerve for both, being fitly quallified for all Capacities of either Sex, no where charged with Obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any thing misbecomming the perſons, whoſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters it lively repreſents, but handing their ſame down to future Ages. If I preſage aright, it ſhall live till time is no more. If brave Exploits in Warr, or ſingle Combates,
<pb facs="tcp:30531:3"/>
if you ſeek here, you may behold it lively repreſented, as if you hazarded your ſelf in the bloody field of <hi>Mars</hi> to ſatisfie that curioſity. If Courtſhip pleaſe you, <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf, nor her winged Son, have not the power to give you a better ſatisfaction. If Beauty, behold it as in a Mirror, If Conſtancy and Inviolate faith. rewarded with all terreſtial felicity, you prize, here it is to be found. If State-pollicies, &amp;c. you are deſirous to dive into, ſee the Councels of Emperors and Kings lay'd open, and all miſteries worthy the higheſt Earthly thought unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And to be brief, there is nothing of this nature that can be reaſonably deſired, but it is to be found in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant miſterious Arcania; which makes him the bolder to recommend it to your good likeing.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30531:4"/>
having with his fair Princeſs ſtayed a while in all manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, he greatly deſired to return into his own Country, to do which, he procured leave of the Emperor his Father-in-Law, and ſo with a great Train of Nobility Imbarqued; When after being ſome time detained by contrary Winds at Sea, they Landed in <hi>Enlgand,</hi> to the great joy of <hi>Fredrick</hi> the aged King, and all his Nobles; ſo that the Feaſting was ſo great, that the like in any age had not been known: Yet the ſudden change of Air, and long Voyage at Sea, together with her Teeming, ſo altred the fair Princeſſes Conſtitution, that falling into a Feaver, it much abated the former joy; but eſpecially of <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> who ſending for the moſt Skilful Phyſicians, he commanded them to uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt skill for her recovery: Whereupon, after much obſervation, they told him, the pleaſanteſt Air that could be found, would be the moſt contributing to her Health; and that none could be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than near ſome Forreſt, River, or in a pleaſant Meadow: In complyance with which, he that would ſpare no Charge to give her eaſe, who was as dear to him as life, commanded a Royal Pavilion to be made, and afterwards to be carryed with all things neceſſary and fit for the Entertainment of the Princeſs, to the Verge of a pleaſant Grove, by which run a Silver trill of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Meandering the flowery Meads: And hither was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs brought in a Chair of State, and things made in as ample manner for her Reception as if ſhe had been in her Lords Pallace: But as Fortune would have it, when ſhe began, through the means that were daily uſed to recover her Health and Strength, a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noiſe was heard in the Forreſt, which the Prince and his Nobles ſuppoſing to be made by ſome Wild Beaſt, Armed and Mounted on Horſe-back, when immediately they eſpyed amongſt the Thickets, a monſtrous Wild Boar, with horrid Tusks and flaming Eyes; whereupon the Dogs were uncoupled, and the Prince followed ſwiftly after the flying Beaſt, inſomuch that his Nobles ſoon loſt ſight of him; nor could they, notwithſtanding the loud ſhouts they made, have any anſwer; ſo that night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, they reſolved to return to the Pavilion, for thither they imagined their Lord would come; yet were they greatly perplexed leaſt he ſhould ſuſtain any damage: Howſoever, return they did,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30531:4"/>
and comforted the Princeſs in the beſt wiſe, leaſt through grief, ſhe might Relapſe.</p>
               <p>The Prince ſeperated from his Nobles as aforeſaid, and night coming faſt upon him, he having wandred in vain to find the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion as long as the night continued; by this time being weary and faint, having alſo loſt his Game, deſcended from his Horſe, and faſtening him to a ſpreading Beach, laid himſelf down upon the Graſs, thinking with the mornings Dawne to be upon his way; when reſtleſly paſſing over the tedious Dark, in often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the affliction the Princeſs would be in for want of his Company, up he gets the next morning, and paſſes along the ſide of a pleaſant River, till he eſpy'd a fair Caſtle, at which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to inquire his way: Where upon his arrival, he found the Gates open, and a Porter ſtanding before them, who welcomed the Prince, deſiring him to enter, which he did, and found it to be a ſpacious place, richly adorned, and in ſuch good order, that he could not refrain wondring thereat; when as he no ſooner paſſed through a great Hall, but entring the next Room, he was encountred by a beautiful Lady, who appeared to be Governeſs of the Caſtle, to whom he made low obedience, and ſhe returning the like Complement, welcomed him in a courteous manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Name, Country, and the occaſion of his coming thither; all which he told her; whereat ſhe ſeemed wonderfully pleaſed, and intreated him in all love, to honour her Caſtle for that night with his preſence, and that the next morning ſhe would diſmiſs him with a guide to the place he ſought. The Prince invited in this manner by a beautiful Lady, could not in point of Generoſity, refuſe ſuch a Courteſie, though his heart was ſtill with fair <hi>Flerida:</hi> And thereupon the Tables were ſpread with Proviſion of every ſort, and Wine in abundance, all brought in by inviſible ways; and over and above, the moſt Melodious Muſick was heard, but no perſons or Inſtruments ſeen; which raiſed an admiration in the Prince what it ſhould mean; yet being a Man of a daring reſolution, he reſolved if poſſible, to ſee the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the Adventure verily believing, as indeed it was true, that the Lady was an Enchantreſs; and that whate're he had obſerved was created by the power of Magick: Yet down he ſat,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30531:5"/>
and immediately perceived all the Seats filled with either Sexes, in rich Attire, who to his thinking, were really ſo; and that they fed heartily as himſelf imagined he did. The Banquet tnded, they roſe up to Dance, and after that vaniſhed; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lady came to the Prince and bid him be of good chear, entertaining him with amorous glances, and night being come, ſhe demanded of him, whether he would be conducted to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? To which, by reaſon of his long Travel, and all-nights Lodging before, he readily conſented: When divers ſeeming Gallants attended him, as alſo did the Lady and her Damoſels; ſo that in his Fathers Court he never was more Nobly attended; when entring his Chamber, he found divers Lamps of Gold burning, whoſe flames were fed with <hi>Naptha</hi> and <hi>Apthaltis,</hi> all the Ceeling appearing to be fretted Gold, and the Walls hung round with curious Pictures, repreſenting Wars and Stories of Knights: The floor was Cedar, and the Bed of Purple Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, Fringed with Gold, and all Embroidered o're with Pearl and Stones, that dazled by reflected Light, the admiring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eyes, who had never ſeen the like before: Yet to Bed he went, and ſoon by Magick Spells, was Charmed into ſlumber; when as <hi>Eutrope</hi> the fair Enchantreſs, ſent her Virgin to fetch the Princes Sword which he had put under his Beds-head, to reſiſt any Enchantment that might be practiſed upon his Perſon; that Sword being of ſuch vertue, that no Spells had power to injure him whilſt it was in his poſſeſſion; the which the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel having effected, the Enchantreſs ſent it to <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> her Kinſman, a Monſtrous Gyant, and one that ſought the ruine of <hi>Don Edoard</hi> for the death of his Father, ſlain in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by <hi>Fredrick</hi> the Princes Father; who upon notice of what had paſſed, haſted to the Caſtle, and rudely preſſing into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Chamber with many Exclamations, awaked him, threatning to revenge what had happened by the hand of the Father, upon the Son; whereat the Prince ſtarting from his ſlumber, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf in danger, groped for his Sword, but finding it gone, he, like a Lyon beſet with Hunters, ſcorning to be afraid, graſped a Pillar of the Bed, and tearing it down, laid at his Monſtrous Foe, but being oppreſſed by multitudes, was forced to

yield; and thereupon the Gyant at the inſtance of <hi>Eutrope,</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his life, caſt him into Irons, and conveyed him into a ſtrong Priſon on the top of the Caſtle, where in great miſery he continued many years, as will in the ſequel appear.</p>

Now the cauſe why the Grant <hi>Dramuſiand's</hi> Father fell, was this: The Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> named <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and <hi>Trineus,</hi> Son to the Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> the latter fell in love with the fair Princeſs <hi>Agricola,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Fredrick,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> who ſo far prevailed, that he was in great likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to have her in Marriage: But ſo it happened, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and divers Knights and Ladies, attending the Queen and Princeſs <hi>Agricola</hi> to a neighbouring Forreſt, there to Recreate themſelves: <hi>Frenaque</hi> a monſtrous Gyant, Father to <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiand,</hi> deſirous to get the Princeſs in Marriage, and having been taking the opportunity of their being unarmed, came upon them with twenty of his followers, and in ſpight of the reſiſtance they made, took from them the Queen and Princeſs; of which King <hi>Fredrick</hi> having notice, cauſed them all to Arm themſelves, and purſued the Gyant, when overtaking him, a fierce Combat began, in which the Gyant and almoſt all his followers, were ſlain, and divers of the Princes and Knights on the other hand, ſore-wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

ſo that the Queen and Princeſs were at that time reſcued, which made the Enchantreſs <hi>Eutrope,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Frenaque,</hi> vow revenge, and incite the Son to take ſatisfaction for his Mothers Blood upon any of the Kingly race, where ever he could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently meet them; the Enchantreſs in the mean while uſing her utmoſt endeavour to bring them into his power, which ſhe firſt effected upon the Prince, as is before ſaid: Yet ſoon after, the Gyant a little relenting, took off his Irons, and gave him liberty to walk about the Caſtle; yet ſo great was the grief of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for his loſs, that after divers Knights had ſearched for him in vain, and chiefly for Sir <hi>Pridos,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Gauls,</hi> who had notice of his being alive, by <hi>Argonida</hi> the Enchantreſſes Daughter, but not of the place of his reſidence, ſhe fell in Labour, and was delivered of two fair Sons, one of which was, by her expreſs command, Baptized by the Name of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> according to the Name of her Father; and the other <hi>Florin du Deſerta,</hi> or <hi>Florin of the Forreſt;</hi> the better for the future to put her in mind of the hardſhip ſhe had ſuſtained: At what time being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by her Ladies to leave that ſolitary place, and retire to the Court, ſhe reſolved upon it; when in the mean time, by the power of the Enchantreſs, the two Infants were taken from her by force in this manner.</p>

                  <hi>Divineſt Creature, how have you captivated my Heart! how have your Beautious Eyes ſhot Beams of Love into my Soul, and made me all o're tranſport! Yet you know not your power, nor the Fever that I indure, but may, when I have proved my ſelf worthy of ſo much Felicity: O my</hi> Miragarda! <hi>well thou art ſtiled The Mirrour and Perfection of Beauty, that with one look could captivate a Soul like mine.</hi> And here he ended with many ſighs; whereupon <hi>Primalion,</hi> who had ſtood all this while unſeen, advancing, ſaluted him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to deſiſt and relinquiſh ſuch vain paſſion; which ſo inraged the Knight, that he hid him defiance, and having his Horſe at hand, mounted, upon which both couching their Spears ran furiouſly at each other, inſomuch, that they were both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed; when drawing their Swords, they encountered with great fury, giving to each other many grievous wounds, ſo that in the end <hi>Primalions</hi> Helmet unbuckling, fell off, upon which he being diſcovered to his Son the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> he caſt down his Sword, and falling at his feet, begged his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and confeſſed an intire ſorrow for oppoſing, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, his Princely Father; <hi>Primalion</hi> hearing this, and perceiving the Knight he fought with to be his Son <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> raiſed him from the ground in his Armes, and embraced him, greatly rejoycing he had found in him ſuch haughty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

               <p>To the Requeſt of the Lady, Prince <hi>Primalion</hi> anſwered, That the Adventure of the <hi>Unfortunate Caſtle</hi> was finiſhed, and that the Knights that had long been impriſoned therein, were fat at liberty; and amongſt the reſt, Prince <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> in ſearch of whom ſo many Knights had left their Country;

and that he at preſent flouriſhed in his Father's Court, in the embraces of the fair <hi>Flerida.</hi> This news greatly revived the ſorrowful Lady, who ſaid ſhe joyed in nothing more than to hear of the Princes ſafety, whom ſhe long ſince ſuppoſed to have been dead, though he had proved moſt unkind to her, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her after ſhe had fixed on him an unalterable love; yet ſtace there were ſome hopes left that ſhe might once more ſee him, ſhe would from thence forward mitigate her grief; And ſo, ſoon after the Prince's departure, ſhe betook her ſelf to the <hi>Garden of Virgins,</hi> a place ſo called for its pleaſant ſcituation.</p>

               <p>But long it had not continued, e're a Meſſenger came from the Soldian <hi>Bellagris</hi> with Letters-Credentials, to inform the Emperor, that the Soldian of <hi>Babylon</hi> (at the inſtigation of <hi>Eutrope</hi> the Inchantreſs) had leavyed a great Army to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade

This reſolve was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved by the Prince, and urged to be put in ſpeedy practice; whereupon the Princeſs feigning a Letter, from her Aunt the Queen of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that ſhe was ſick, at the point of Death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſiring to ſee her, ſhe ſhewed it to her Father, and by many intreaties ſo prevailed, that he conſented to her going; when to accompany her, ſhe choſe no other train than <hi>Florian,</hi> called in that Court the Chriſtian Knight, four Eſquires, and ſix Damoſels, all which mounting early in the morning, left the City, and rode without meeting any interruption, till they came into the confines of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where meeting four Knights, and they beholding the beauty of the Princeſs, would have taken her from Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> which ſo inraged him, that running one of them through with his Launce, he ſlew the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two with his ſword, whereat the fourth fled: When ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little further, and entering a pleaſant Valley, he cauſed the Tent to be pitched for the Princeſs, and there, by reaſon it was late, he continued with her all night; when in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſet forward and rode till they came to a pleaſant foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, at which they alighted to drink the water; when as two Kts. riding by, who had been conquered by <hi>Albayzer,</hi> knew the Princeſs by the reſemblance of her Picture, when alighting,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30531:51"/>
they layed hold on her, ſwearing, that ſince for her ſake they had received the diſgrace, they would carry her as a Priſoner to their Miſtriſſes, thereby to make an attoanment for them, which rudeneſs ſo offended the Prince, that drawing his ſword, at one blow he cut off the hand of him that graſped the Princeſs, and afterward ſlew the other, which he that was wounded ſeeing, intreated the Princeſs to beg for his life, which at her requeſt was granted; and his <abbr>Eſq</abbr> having bound up his wound, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in a heavy condition.</p>
               <p>Theſe miſchances ſo afflicted the fair <hi>Targiana,</hi> that ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prince to haſten thence; but long they had not travelled e'r they beheld a Knight lying under a fair ſpreading Tree, greatly bemoaning his misfortune, for falling under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of his Miſtriſs; to whoſe amorous complaints they liſtened ſo long, that the Kt. turning about, eſpyed them, when riſing in great anger, he bid the Prince prepare for the combat, ſince he had heard his fond diſcourſe, he ſhould no where report it to his diſgrace, but at that time he ſhould remember his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; whereupon he left the Lady to be ſpectator of the dreadful combat; for although they received wounds on either ſide, yet neither gained a foot of ground, which made each of them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but ſo it happened, whileſt they ſo earneſtly like Lyons or Tygars fought, a Knight came riding up, when beholding the fair Princeſs, and knowing her by her portraicture, he cauſed his <abbr>Eſq</abbr> by force to caſt her behind him, and rode as faſt as he might, undiſcerned of the combatants, who through eagerneſs to ſtrike and guard, neither heard nor ſaw her; yet her train that was ſome diſtance, followed hard after their Lady: But ſo it happened, that a while after <hi>Dramuſiand</hi> riding in ſearch of the Shield, and ſeeing two Kts. hotly ingaged, ſuddenly came up, when by the Dragon one of them bare in his Shield, he knew him to be Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who the better to be unknown, had altered his Device, when crying aloud, <hi>Prince</hi> Palmerin, <hi>what means this mortal combat? And what occaſioned it?</hi> Now <hi>Florian</hi> no ſooner heard that name, but he recoiled, and threw down his Sword, diſcovering who he was, whereupon the two Brethren (no longer Foes) embraced each other, &amp; begged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that ſo ignorantly they had ſhed each others Blood: But

But being ſafe on ſhore, and ſeeing the Caſtle before him, where he had notice from the perſon who had required his help, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture was, he came before it; but finding it ſeated upon an high Rock, and but one way, very narrow to aſcend, he drew his Sword and mounted, (by reaſon of the height, he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to reſt divers times;) when looking for the Old Man, whom he ſuppoſed to have followed him, he found him miſſing, whereupon he began to ſuſpect ſome treachery; yet nothing daunted, he reſolved to try the utmoſt: So that arriving at the top of the Rock, he came to the Gate, which he found open, when inſtead of Armed Men, whom he expected, he met with three beautifull Damzels Richly attired, who came forth to welcome him, which increaſed his wonder; yet ſcorning to fear ſuch fair Enemies, he followed them into a ſtately Hall, at the upper end of which, in a Chair of State, ſate a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Lady of great ſtature, who upon his approach aroſe to meet him, giving him leave to ſalute her, then ſhe welcomed him in a kind manner, feigning much joy to have ſo much Honour as a viſit from a Knight ſo high in the favour of Fortune, telling him he muſt repoſe there that night, and that on the morrow ſhe would inform him of the Adventure to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, with which he ſeemed well content; whereupon he was lead into a ſtately Parlour, where the Tables were ſpread with all manner of proviſion, and after ſome Complements made, ſate down, frequently caſting his eyes upon one of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels that ſerved at the Table, whoſe beauty he fancied to be carer than what he ever had ſeen before; nor was ſhe wanting to entertain him with amorous glances: Supper ended, he was by that Damzel conducted to his Lodging, who laying baſhfulneſs aſide, promiſed to yield her Honour to be at his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal, ſo ſoon as conveniency would permit; and ſo giving him a flattering kiſs, ſhe ſlipped a King upon his finger (as ſhe ſaid) in pledge of her future good will: But ſo it happened, That it had a Stone in it, the Virtue of which ſuddenly caſt the Prince into a dead ſleep, when the large-ſized Lady, whoſe Name was <hi>Arleucia,</hi> entring the Chamber, and beholding the Prince o'rewhelmed with drowſieneſs, ſhe thus began to rejoyce:</p>

               <p>Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> having attained the River, where the Eſquire had informed him his Lord paſſed, found there neither Boat nor Bridge; yet riding along the hither bank, he at laſt found a place where it was fordable; when coming to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which by the deſcription the Sage gave of it, he well knew to be the ſame, whereupon with his drawn Sword he mounted the Stairs, meeting by the way with many airey Fantomes, but no humane oppoſition, which made him boldly enter, when all he found, was a Damzel, who ſeeing him approach with his drawn Sword, ſhrieked aloud, and was about to fly; but the Prince taking her by the arm, charged her upon her Life to inform him what was become of the Knight, that not many days before came to the Caſtle? Whereupon ſhe trembling, and faultering in her ſpeech, replied: <hi>That that morning he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by her Lady</hi> Arlutea, <hi>and</hi> Alfernao, <hi>who (in a Trance) having put him on Skip-board, had carryed him (at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of</hi> Collumbra <hi>her Ladys Mother) to the</hi> Profound Iſland, <hi>where they intended to put him to death, in revenge of the Death of the four Gyants ſlain by him and his Brother; the ſaid Gyants being Sons to</hi> Collumbra, <hi>and Brothers to</hi> Arleucea; <hi>who had left her Country to be nearer the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Court, that ſhe might the better effect her purpoſed Revenge.</hi> This news greatly diſturbed the Prince, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering there was no time to be loſt, he made the Damzel ſwear to the truth of what ſhe had ſaid, and to deſcribe the Caſtle of the Gyanteſs <hi>Collumbra;</hi> as alſo the Ship wherein they were imbarqued: Which done he haſted to the Sea-ſide, and made all the haſte imaginable to imbarque, diſmiſſing his

Eſquire, to expect him at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and bear his reſpects to the fair <hi>Polinarda,</hi> deſiring her good wiſhes for effecting the Enterprize he had undertaken.</p>
               <p>Now ſo it happened, that <hi>Aliart</hi> knowing what had paſſed, and that they were upon the Sea, as ſoon as they came within ſight of the Iſland where the Gyanteſs lived, raiſed ſuch a ſtorm, that by contrary Winds they were driven upon a ſtrange Coaſt, yet could not (by reaſon of the mighty Rocks) Land, but were forced to ride it out at Sea, when they were carried up to Heaven and down to Hell, ſo tempeſtuous were the Winds, and ſo dreadful the ſurface of the Deep, that every moment they expected to periſh; whereupon <hi>Arleucea</hi> began to repent of what ſhe had undertaken, wiſhing ſhe was again in her Caſtle, and that Prince <hi>Florian</hi> had not come thither: Yet often was ſhe determined to kill him on Ship-board, but feared to be letted, by reaſon the Marriners were ignorant of the Conſpiracy againſt his Life; but in the end imagining that Heaven was offended at her unjuſt determination, and that all were at the brink of Ruin; after divers cogitations, ruminating in her mind how her Brethren fell in ſingle Combat, and the Princes only defended themſelves, ſhe (after having conſulted <hi>Alfernao</hi>) reſolved to take off the Charm, and keep the Prince in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what had been deſigned againſt his Life: Wherefore going to the Cabin where he lay, and having taken off the Ring, ſhe ſprinkled a certain Iuice upon his face, which ſoon reſtored him to his ſenſes; and as ſoon the ſtorm began to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>The Prince finding himſelf on Ship-board, began to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel how he came there; when gazing about him, beheld <hi>Arleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> knowing her to be the ſame Lady that had Feaſted him in her Caſtle; whereupon he took her by the hand, and cauſing her to ſit down by him, after many gentle ſpeeches towards her, demanded how he came thither, and what the Adventure was he ſhould finiſh? But ſhe diſſembling the matter a while, in the end (ſeeing his Princely Carriage, great Beauty, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Civility) gave ſuch ſcope to her paſſion, that earneſtly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30531:67"/>
repenting of what ſhe before intended, falling on her knees, ſhe firſt with tears begged his pardon for the Body-Treachery deſigned againſt his life, and then related from point to point what had happened, and what was further intended; whereat he Marvelling fell likewiſe on his knees, and gave thanks to Heaven; then riſing, he pardoned <hi>Arleucea,</hi> but ſhe laying all the contrivance of the matter to <hi>Alfernao,</hi> he could be hardly intreated to ſpare his life; but in the end, conſidering Age, and that by taking his life he ſhould render himſelf inglorious, he was content, he ſhould be confined a perpetual Priſoner in a Caſtle on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> belonging to King <hi>Recinde,</hi> whither by this time the Tempeſt had driven them; and there landing, he with the young Gyanteſs, and four Damzels he found on board with her, travelled ſo long, that coming into a pleaſant Valley, they eſpied two fair Tents, and by them walking four Ladies, who ſeeing them approach, one of them merrily ſaid, <hi>Sir Knight, you are well ſtocked with Ladies, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Prince (as is ſaid) having taken Shipping, after a while being toſſed on the Seas, came to a Port of the <hi>Profound Iſland,</hi> near to which he found a ſmall Cottage, where entring he eſpied a grave perſon, who aroſe up and welcomed him; when as the Prince ſitting down, began to inquire into the ſtate of the Country, and received anſwer, That it was an Iſland plentifully ſtored with all things; and that over it not long before ruled a Gigantick Tyrant named <hi>Bravorant,</hi> who committed all manner of Murthers, Rapin, and Violence, but kind Heaven in the end cut him off: Yet left he by his Wife <hi>Collumbra</hi> four Sons, <hi>viz.

the Port, entered a Barge, and rowed to his Gally ſide, and there received him with many Complements, and from thence rowed him to the ſhore, all the Ayr being filled with ſounds of Harmony; when coming to the Court, he was conducted by King <hi>Polendos,</hi> and Prince <hi>Primaleon,</hi> before the Chair of State, where the Emperor was ſeated in his Emperial Robes; when after complements on either ſide paſſed, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador had taken his place, he firſt delivered his Letters, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, under the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Seal; after which he thus began:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Know, Moſt Puiſſant Emperor, that from the Mighty</hi> Ottoman <hi>Emperor (my Lord and Maſter) I am ſent to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you in his Name, and to give you knowledge, that his Emperial Diadem has been ſtained, and its bright dazling Luſtre much impaired, by the Indignity offered him, in the Perſon of his Daughter, conveyed from his Court by</hi> Florian, <hi>a Knight of your Court: Wherefore, if you expect Peace at his hands, it can be preſerved at no other rate, than by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him up to be deſervedly puniſhed, who has offered ſuch inſolence to his</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Majeſty, as to give the World occaſion of diſcourſe, and blot the Name of that fair Lady, who is the ſolace of his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This having ſaid, he ended; and the Emperor made this reply:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Know, Sir, I am deſirous of your Lords friendſhip, and ſeek not War in my declining years, but rather wiſh to ſpend the ſmall remainder of my life in Peace, therefore expected no ſuch Command to be layed on me, which (if I judge aright) is to no other end deſign'd, then to create a new ground for War: If ſo, I might more juſtly ſeek Revenge for the injury and ingratitude my Knights have ſuſtained in recompence of my Commands and their good will. As for the Princeſs, I own my ſelf obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30531:72"/>
at my Court, as ſhe could be regarded in her Fathers. As for the Prince you ſpeak of, though he is my Grandſon, yet he is not my Subject; nor can I compel free minds, if that I would; but ſurely rather than I would deliver him up to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Rage, (were it in my power, and he would conſent) I'de freely hazard my Empire in Fortunes chance: And now you have my Anſwer, you may ſtay and have the Freedom of my Court, or depart at Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor thus ending, with a Majeſtick frown greatly diſmayed the Ambaſſador, who without replying was about to retire to his Gallys, but that the Princes ſtayed him to make merry, and received the Emperors Letter, to which he conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo after three days tarryance, he returned to him that ſent him; where I ſhall leave him, and return to Prince <hi>Florian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince, with his Troop of Ladies, having reached the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> ſent his Eſquire to the King and Queen, to implore them that they would permit the Knights of their Court to Iuſt againſt a ſtrange Knight, in the behalf of their Ladies, for that he would maintain the Beauty of thoſe that accompanied him againſt any of the Court-Ladies, if ſo be it any Knights durſt maintain the contrary. The King, who had delighted from his Youth in Feats of Arms, appeared no way averſe, but rather deſired that the Valour of his Knights ſhould be tryed, whereupon he diſmiſſed the Eſquire with a promiſe that his Maſters requeſt ſhould on the morrow be granted, and that for that night Lodgings ſhould be provided for him and his Lady. The Prince having now an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to try his force againſt the feeble Knights of <hi>Spain,</hi> made no doubt but by his Proweſs to Eclipſe the Glory of that Court, in Honour of the Emperor, and therefore retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King <hi>Recinde</hi> great thanks.</p>
               <p>The night being ſpent in Mirth and Iollitry, the next morning they prepared for the Liſt, the Trumpets loudly ſounding thereto, which awakened the Knights; when mounting their Steeds, they advanced, and found the Prince
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30531:73"/>
in the Liſt; whereupon a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knight, in white Armour, with a wounded Heart in his Shield, confronted him, at what time the Prince ſent to acquaint him, That if himſelf was conquored, the Knight ſhould chuſe from amongſt his Train the moſt beautifull Damzel; but if he vanquiſhed the Knight, he would have his Miſtriſs, and therefore required him to aſſign her; to which the Knight whoſe Name was <hi>Gonzales,</hi> ſent this Reply; That he doubted not but the ſtrange Knight was weary of his Female Company, and therefore came to put them off at any rate; but as for his Miſtriſs, his power was ſo little over her, that ſhe was alltogether at her own diſpoſal. This anſwer ſo diſpleaſed the Prince, that he gave ſignal for the Iuſt, without any conditions: When running furiouſly at each other, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knight was thrown from his Horſe, with his Heels upwards, which ſo grieved him, that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Combat of the Sword, which the Prince as readily granted, but the King forbad it: Yet a ſecond Knight run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the Prince, fared no better, and ſo a third, till all his Launces were broken, ſo that he was obliged to intreat of the King a new ſupply, and with them had the Iuſt ſix houres, none being able to unhorſe him, which ſore abaſhed the King, to ſee his Knights diſgraced, and the Fame of his Court Eclipſed by one Knight, inſomuch that he repented he had granted the diſport, and thereupon for that day cauſed it to ceaſe, intending it ſhould be no more; but upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of ſome Knights, that upon the fame of the Exerciſe newly arrived there, it was renewed the next day; when as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knights fared no better than the day before, which cooled their courage.</p>
               <p>Matters going thus, the Prince reſolved to depart to the Caſtle of <hi>Almorol</hi> the next morning, of which <hi>Arleucea</hi> having notice, watching her opportunity, when her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were aſleep, ſhe ſtole into the Prince's Lodging-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where a Taper was burning, and ſitting down upon his Bed-ſide, began to ſigh out her paſſion in this order:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:30531:73"/>
                  <hi>O unfortunate that I am! How am I captivated in the ſnares of Love, and forced to do at upon the Man that ſlights my paſſion? O that I had never ſeen his face, unleſs he would have more regarded me, and pittied the Feavour that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes me.</hi> This ſaid, ſhe began to weep tenderly; whereupon the Prince awaking, wondered to ſee a woman in his Chamber, but by the light diſcovering who it was; and ſhe ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing her lamentations, he comforted her in the beſt wiſe, promiſing that allthough himſelf intended not to marry her, yet he would beſtow her upon ſuch a Husband, as ſhould pleaſe her: This abſolute denyal diſturbed her more than before, ſo that caſting her Arms about the Prince, ſhe lay as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced for a pretty ſpace; but recovering hee ſenſes, and modeſt baſhfulneſs, ſhe left him, and retired to her Chamber; where awaking one of her Damzels named <hi>Polephemia,</hi> ſhe imparted to her the Secrets of her Heart, deſiring her to go to the Prince, and perſwade him that night to receive her into his Arms, and ſatisfie the deſires of a longing Virgin. But this Damzel, who was the ſame that put the inchanted King upon the Prince's finger, having the opportunity of being alone with him ſolicited her own (inſtead of her Ladies) cauſe ſo long, that he having born her good-will ever ſince he firſt beheld her, laying niceties aſide, ſo dealt with her, that to both their contents he poſſeſſed her Virgin Treaſure, and ſent her blithe and gay with Loves refreſhments, when the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dawn, to carry Cordial words to her diſconſolate Lady, who little ſuſpected what had paſſed, yet deſired no greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>In the morning early the Prince and his beautiful Female Troop taking leave of the King, Queen, and Court-Ladies, departed towards the Caſtle of <hi>Almorol;</hi> but coming into a pleaſant Valley before them, they beheld a Knight of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſlye come riding on a Horſe greater than <hi>Beaucephalus,</hi> with two Eſquires of his attendance: When coming near the Prince, and beholding the Ladies, he rudely layed hold of <hi>Arleucea,</hi> ſwearing ſhe ſhould hear him company, and that two
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30531:74"/>
others ſhould be allotted to his Eſquires: This rough and unſeemly action ſo moved the Prince, that drawing his Sword, he came at him to revenge the Injury, which the Knight (or rather Gyant) perceiving, let go his hold, and drawing his Maſſy Blade, a dreadfull Combat began; but ſo eager was the Prince to revenge the affront, that the Gyant received many wounds, till in the end fainting, through the loſs of blood, he fell; when taking off his Helmet, the Prince being about to ſmite off his Head, his Eſquires fell on their Knees, and with tears begged him to ſpare their Lords Life, which the Ladyes perceiving, interceded ſo much on his behalf, that the Prince was contented to ſpare his Life, conditionally, that he would tell his Name, and go to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and there relate what had befallen him; both which he ſwore to do, ſaying, <hi>He was called</hi> Trofolant the Fearfull; <hi>And as for the other part of his Oath, though it would redound much to his diſgrace, yet would he faithfully perform it:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was ſuffered to depart.</p>
               <p>The Prince having chaſtiſed the inſolency of the Gyant, paſſed on till he met three Knights, compleatly armed, paſſing a little River, who eſpying one Knight conducting ſo many Ladyes, agreed amongſt themſelves to take each of them one; whereupon coming up, one choſe <hi>Arleucea,</hi> another <hi>Poliphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and the third <hi>Arteſia; Nay, Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid the Prince, <hi>you muſt firſt ask my leave, which (aſſure your ſelves) you will not obtain, e're any of theſe Ladys fall to your ſhare. That needs not,</hi> ſaid one of the Knights, <hi>for we will be our own Carvers; yet (truſt me) we will ſo kindly uſe the Ladys, that they ſhall have no cauſe to repent the change. I ſee</hi> (ſaid the Prince) <hi>you are reſolutely bent to leſſen my Train, if poſſible, therefore prepare to win them, and they are freely yours, for unleſs you purchaſe them at the price of my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, you muſt not expect to have them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of the Prince greatly pleaſing the Knights,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30531:74"/>
they began to contemn his force, and vaunt of their own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour beyond meaſure; but ſo it happened, that in the Iuſt they were all overthrown, and remitted for a puniſhment of their preſumption to the Ladies they had claimed, who injoyned them to tell their Names, and go to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> as had the Gyant, and there (in the preſence of the King and his Knights) declare what had befallen them, and by whoſe hand; to which with a mournful voice one of them replyed: <hi>That allthough the Sentence was ſevere, yet ſeeing it was their misfortune to be conquored, they would not decline it; As for our Names,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am called</hi> Grovanel, <hi>this other Knight is my Brother</hi> Brabazan, <hi>and the third</hi> Claribard; <hi>all of us Knights of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Court, which makes us the lother to make our diſgrace publique there; yet upon the Oaths of our Knighthood, ſeeing the Ladys have injoyned it, it ſhall be performed:</hi> And thereupon the Prince diſmiſſed them, and kept on his way towards the Caſtle of the Gyant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morol.</hi>

                  <p> Of the Gyant and three Knights arrival at the Court of <hi>Spain:</hi> And of the arrival of Prince <hi>Florian</hi> at the Caſtle of the Gyant <hi>Almorol;</hi> and what enſued thereon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Gyant <hi>Trofolant</hi> (according to his Oath) arriving at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> after admittance had to the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, began to declare the occaſion of his coming, and tell the whole matter, which did not a little perplex the King to know who the Knight with the Damzels was; but whilſt the doubt laſted, the other Knights came in, and became Relaters of their own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which ſtill increaſed the wonder, and ſomewhat leſſened the diſgrace of thoſe Knights that had been overthrown in the preſence of their Ladies, but in the end they concluded it muſt be one of the invincible Sons of Prince <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> and thereupon reſted themſelves ſatisfied as well as they could.</p>
               <p>The Prince riding on in the company of his Ladies, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſo long, that he came within ſight of <hi>Almorol</hi>'s Caſtle, when to his beautifull Companions he thus began: <hi>Ladies know that we approach the Caſtle where dwells the fair</hi> Miragarda, <hi>whoſe Beauty is famed for excellent throughout the World, therefore agree amongſt your ſelves whoſe Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſhall fight under:</hi> when as a murmure aroſe amongſt them, every one thinking her ſelf the faireſt, till <hi>Poliphemia,</hi> who had a wonderfull conceit of her beauty, thus broke ſilence: <hi>Sir Knight, if you fight under Beauty's Banner, it behoves you to be loyal and conſtant in your Love, for I perſwade my ſelf, if the Knight that protects the Shield of</hi> Miragarda <hi>was not ſo, Fortune would not favour him as ſhe does, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe but ſome of us are as beautifull as ſhe; therefore if you are unfortunate in the Enterprize, attribute it to your
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30531:75"/>
unconſtancy, and not to the Defect of our Beauty.</hi> The Prince hearing her ſay thus much, could not refrain ſmiling to think of the eſteem ſhe had of her ſelf, and what had paſſed between them; yet giving her and the reſt many Complements, they at laſt came to the River <hi>Theſin,</hi> that encompaſſed the Caſtle, on which they beheld <hi>Miragarda</hi> and her Damzels in a Boat, whoſe beauty was ſo excellent, that it had well nigh conquored the Prince, but he who was alltogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in Love, ſoon ſhook off her Chaines.</p>
               <p>The Prince had not long ſtayed before the Caſtle, but <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi> ſent his Eſquire to him, to acquaint him with the cuſtom of the Caſtle; <hi>Nay,</hi> (ſaid Prince <hi>Florian) tell thy Lord I am very well acquainted with the cuſtom, and came hither on purpoſe to break a Launce with the Guardian of</hi> Miragarda<hi>'s Beauty:</hi> Vpon notice whereof <hi>Florendos</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and prepared for the Iuſt; but the Prince (not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to injure his Kinſman) declared that he would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Combat of the Sword, but came to ſhew his Ladys Paſtime, not being <hi>Emulus</hi> to bereave him of his truſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Florendos</hi> ſaluted him, and was deſirous to know his Name, but he refuſed, ſo that the Iuſt began with great vehemency; yet ſuch was the regard that <hi>Florian</hi> had for his Nephew, that he would not diſgrace him in the fight of his Lady, who ſtood in the Window to behold the Iuſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they broke three Launces without any advantage, which ſo inraged <hi>Florendos,</hi> (who was alltogether ignorant of his Adverſaries ſtrength) that he would have tryed the Combat of the Sword, but Prince <hi>Florian</hi> with gentle words per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to the contrary, deſiring that that might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>Almorol</hi> the Gyant, againſt whom he was deſirous to try his ſtrength; which made the Ladies that bore him company to ſmile, miſ-doubting the Courage of their moſt valiant Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almorol</hi> having notice that the combat was required a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, went to his fair Miſtriſs, and required her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who (becauſe the Iuſts were not decided) accorded to his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30531:76"/>
Requeſt; whereupon the Gyant came forth, and defied Prince <hi>Florian</hi> to the combat of the Sword, who (now at liberty to uſe his full ſtrength) greatly rejoyced; inſomuch that the combatants being in a readineſs, charged each other ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, that wounds were received on both ſides, but the Prince (whom Fortune ever favoured) brought the Gyant to his mercy, yet would not injure his Life, allthough in his power, but ſuffered him to be carryed off, and his wounds to be healed, having ingaged, that if himſelf had been overcome, to have beſtowed <hi>Arleucea</hi> in Marriage upon the Gyant.</p>
               <p>During the time that <hi>Florendos</hi> and the attendants of the Caſtle were carrying off the Gyant, and looking to his wounds, two Knights came riding up to the Shield of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> and laying hold on it, would have conveyed it thence, but Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> obſerving his Rinſman to be abſent, forbad them on their peril, yet they regarded not his Menaces, but dared him to the combat to defend it; whereupon he prepared himſelf for the Iuſt, and ran one of them with a ſtrong Staff through the Body, and layed the other on the Earth; by which time <hi>Florendos</hi> was arrived, greatly diſpleaſed that the Iuſt ſhould be performed in his abſence; but when he knew that his Kinſman <hi>Florian</hi> had done him that ſervice, he greatly rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and would have conducted him into the Caſtle, but could not perſwade him to ſtay, for that he had promiſed to return to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to give thoſe Knights a further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Proweſs; whereupon taking leave, he departed with his Female Train, every one of which ſtriving to be higheſt in his favour.</p>
               <p>But far he had not rode e're he heard the piteous ſhreiks of a Lady on the other ſide of a River, and becauſe he could not conveniently come nearer, by reaſon of the depth of the water, he unarmed himſelf and caſt it over, when-leaving the Ladies he had in guard, he ſwam croſs the Flood, and entering the Thicket, beheld a Knight forcing a Damzel, whilſt another Knight was binding her Eſquire to a Tree; which unmanly

abuſe, ſo inraged the Prince, that he commanded them upon pain of Death to deſiſt, but they being two to one ſeemed little to regard his threats, though afterwards they repented it: For the Prince being inraged at ſo great a wickedneſs as they were about to commit, having given them leave to put themſelves in a poſture of defence, charged them with ſuch fury, that he layed one of them breathleſs, and brought the other to his mercy, obligeing him to ask the Lady forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and taking an Oath of him, to go to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and make report of his Villany, and what had befallen him; and ſo unbinding the Damzels Eſquire, he paſſed along the Bank of the River till he found a place fordable, over which he paſſed with the Lady and her Eſquire, demanding the cauſe why they uſed ſuch violence, and how ſhe came to meet with them? to which ſhe anſwered, <hi>That being a Damzel, Attendant upon the Princeſs</hi> Miragarda, <hi>ſhe obtained leave to go to the Court of</hi> Spain, <hi>to viſit her friends, when as theſe Knights having been foiled at the Caſtle of</hi> Almorol, <hi>to revenge that diſgrace, reſolved (upon their knowing who I was) to deprive me of my Honour, having caſt Lots who ſhould have the firſt Eſſay, and had ſucceeded in their Wickedneſs, had not kind Heaven happily ſent you to my reſcue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Damzel had ſcarce ended, when an Out-cry and Female Shreiks was heard, when the Prince looking up, beheld a Knight with <hi>Arleucea</hi> behind him, riding as faſt as poſſible away with her; whereupon he haſtened to recover his Horſe, which done, he rode after him, crying, <hi>Stay Uncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and be chaſtized for the Inſolence you have offered to a Lady under my protection:</hi> Whereat the Knight turning about in great fury, ſet down the Lady, ſaying, <hi>He would be revenged for ſuch his bold interruption;</hi> whereupon drawing his Sword, he advanced, but received ſuch a welcome, that after ſix or ſeven exchanged blows, the Prince brought him under, and would have taken off his Head, but that he begging for life, <hi>Arleucea</hi> pittyed him and interceded on his behalf,

               <p>During this Battel, King <hi>Edoard</hi> rode through all parts, ſuccouring his men where he ſaw moſt need, and making great ſlaughter of the Enemy with his own hands, being attended every where he rode with an hundred choice Knights; when as the Emperor <hi>Palmerin</hi> (who from a Tower beheld the fight, together with the Ladies) greatly marvelled at the Proweſs of the Warriours; deſiring nothing more than to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, had his Age permitted; as not, in his Youth being accuſtomed to be an idle ſpectator, whilſt others fought; yet mindfull of the charge of ſo great a Potentate, he hourly ſent ſuch ſuccours as could be ſpared to reinforce the fainting Regiments, and charge the Enemy with freſh vigor, and to give ſuch orders as he thought convenient.</p>

want of breath, and through loſs of blood, they were obliged to pauſe a while: When as <hi>Palmerin</hi> with a Thouſand Knights charged the Battalian of the Souldian of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and made exceeding ſlaughter, inſomuch, that they fled from him as from their certain death, none being able to reſiſt his force. On the other ſide fought <hi>Florian,</hi> whoſe death the Great <hi>Turk</hi> had ſtrictly injoyned; when thoſe that had it in charge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him far entered amongſt the Ranks of his Enemies, incloſed him on every ſide, and gave him many ſtrokes that bruiſed his Armour, which rouſed his Courage to that degree, that with a force exceeding, he ſo dealt, that ſoon they opened on every ſide; yet fought he ſo long, till ramparts of dead Bodys hemmed him in. But ſo well fared not Prince <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jortes,</hi> for being incloſed by a Squadron of <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe, he fought (in hopes of ſuccour) till through wounds and loſs of blood falling, he gave up the Ghoſt, whoſe death much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Chriſtian Princes, eſpecially Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who intirely loved him, inſomuch, that to revenge his death, he ſo furiouſly charged the King of <hi>Trebeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo long and dreadfull did the fight continue between <hi>Dramuſiand</hi> and <hi>Framuſtant,</hi> that through loſs of blood, and wearineſs, they fainted, and were carryed out of the Battel by their friends on either part.</p>
               <p>Great was the ſorrow of the Ladies, who from the Battel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beheld the fight, there being few of them but had a Husband, Relation, or Friend ingaged, ſo that ſome of them ſeeing the field beſtrewed with ſlaughter, ſwounded away, and others retire their beautious eyes, not being able longer to behold the Tragick action, not knowing what to think of the Battel, or to whom fortune owed the Victory: During the fight, the City was ſtrongly guarded on all parts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a ſurprize.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edoard</hi> retiring from the foiles of War, to take breath and dreſs a wound he had received, within a ſhort time
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30531:95"/>
came on afreſh with a commanded party of Horſe, and made great ſlaughter, inſomuch, that the Infidels gave back, and the Chriſtians on that ſide recovered the ground they had loſt, taking new vigor, and charging couragiouſly, inſomuch, that <hi>Albayzer</hi> coming thither to reſtore the Battel, was over-ſet with the furious Charge of the <hi>Greecian</hi> Horſemen, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thrown to the ground, but ſoon recovering his Legs, he drew his Sword, and killed divers Knights, yet was ſo ſtrongly reſiſted, that there he had been taken or ſlain, had not his Gyants (who alwaies guarded his Perſon) beſtirred themſelves with their mighty Battel-Axes, yet one of them fell by the Sword of Prince <hi>Primalion,</hi> and another was carryed off ſore wounded, of which wounds he ſoon after dyed.</p>
               <p>By this time the Right Wing of the <hi>Turks</hi> was broken and diſordered, being pierced by <hi>Recinde</hi> and the Gyant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morol,</hi> to rally which <hi>Albayzer</hi> ſtrove in vain, till ſuch time as he had reinforced them with Ten Thouſand freſh men, and clapped into the front two of his Gyants, <hi>viz.

               <p>Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Primalion</hi> hearing of the death of <hi>Recinde,</hi> were greatly inraged, and to revenge it, redoubled their ſtrength, fighting like <hi>Lybian</hi> Lyons, ſo that all the ground where they fought was covered with blood and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but <hi>Primalion</hi> having loſt much blood in the fight, and finding himſelf faint, by the advice of his friends (after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

killed above an hundred <hi>Turks</hi> with his own hands) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the City: Yet the Fight waxed hot on all ſides, upon the coming in of freſh ſupplies, ſo that Victory hovered doubtfull over either Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnedes</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> having notice that his Couzen <hi>Recinde</hi> was ſlain, came with <hi>Oniſtaldus</hi> to revenge his death, but after a long fight, in which many of the <hi>Turks, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> were ſlain, the King having his Horſe kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under him, and his Helmet burſt, was ſlain; as alſo was <hi>Oniſtaldus,</hi> in endeavouring his reſcue; but long their Deaths were not unrevenged: For King <hi>Edoard</hi> and Prince <hi>Florian</hi> coming with a freſh Troop of Horſemen, pierced the Squadron of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe, where they found many of their friends incloſed, yet valiantly fighting againſt <hi>Dromo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and divers others, upon which the King and his Son put themſelves between, making great ſlaughter of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though not without ſome wounds received; but ſo eager was the Prince againſt the Gyant, that after a dreadfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with him, he gave him a wound on the right ſide of his Head, which brought him to the ground, when ſetting his Foot upon him, he divided his Head from his Body. Whilſt this was doing, King <hi>Polendos</hi> and <hi>Belcar</hi> entered the Squadron of the King of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> and made great ſlaughter, inſomuch, that Prince <hi>Berolde,</hi> deſirous to revenge his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, coming to their aſſiſtance, the routed <hi>Pagans</hi> in great diſorder fled, not regarding the Perſon of their King, who labouring to reſtrain their flight, was overborn with the trampling of the Horſes.

way apace, as not being qualified to ſuſtain ſuch fury; yet at the ſight of their General, the Captains ſo beſtirred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they brought their men to make a better reſiſtance, ſo that great was the ſlaughter on either part; but ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Princes preſſed on, that through a lane of ſlaughtered foes they at length came, where they found the Gyant <hi>Almorol</hi> fighting againſt a number of the Enemies, in defence of the dead body of <hi>Recinde,</hi> which he reſolved not to leave as a prey to the Enemies, but with his Life; nor could the Princes (though he was extreamly wounded, and had his Helmet broken in divers places) perſwade him to retire, but in the end falling, he (through the many wounds he received, and extream loſs of blood) dyed upon his Maſters body, covering it with his own, which Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> perceiving, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamenting the death of his Father and his moſt faithfull Servant, charged upon the Gyant <hi>Gramalo</hi> (who had moſt in damaged <hi>Almorol</hi>) with ſuch force, that he ſoon brought him to the ground, and ſmote off his Head, whilſt he in vain cryed out for mercy; and following the advantage, he fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Souldian of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who was come thither, and had ſlain him, had not the <hi>Perſians</hi> in great number ran between, and hazarded their lives to ſave their Lord; yet ſo wounded was he, that he was carryed out of the Battel doubtfull whether to recover or not, which gave the Chriſtians oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to carry off the body of the King and Gyant <hi>Almorol,</hi> with many others of note that were ſlain ſince the fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.

contracted; but ſome again (bluſhing) refuſed to tell, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome obſcenety, or wanton thoughts, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going actions of Love and dalliance had cauſed them (ſleeping) to fancy over again; others dreamed of the many hazards and dangers their Lords had undergone for their ſakes; and ſuch Ladyes as were deprived of their happineſs, imagined they embraced for them their empty ſhade, and ſaw their Ghoſt tempting them to follow to the bleſſed <hi>Elizium</hi> ſhades: But when all had related, except the fair <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and none approved, ſhe in the manner aforeſaid delivered the roveing of her fancy; at which the Damzel greatly rejoycing, fell at her Feet, ſaying, <hi>She alone ſhould produce a Prince worthy her Miſtriſſes Love, who ſhould be renowned above Mankind, and do ſuch Wonders, as had not in any foregoing Age been known; but that ſhe would loſe him in his Infantſie, but find him again when ſhe had greateſt need of his aid.</hi>

               <p>The Court being thus repleniſhed with young Princes and Princeſſes, conſiderably abated the ſorrow, conceived for the loſs in the late War, all of which were put into the hands of the moſt skilful Governeſſes, during their tender years, and Tutors appointed, to educate them in accompliſhments, when their years were capable to retain it; ſo that now Feaſting and Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
